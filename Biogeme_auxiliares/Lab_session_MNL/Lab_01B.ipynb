    "In this lab session, we will analyse neighbourhood location choice behaviour. Understanding people's preferences over neighbourhood characteristics is crucial for city planners when they (re)develop neighbourhoods or devise policies to tackle e.g. residential segregation. During this lab session, you will apply discrete choice models to uncover people's preferences over attributes, such as the distance to the city centre and the share of foreigners in their neighbourhood. Also, you will explore whether preferences interact with covariates such as age, gender, home ownership, car ownership and urbanisation level. While doing so, you will test various utility specifications and interpret the modelling outcomes of discrete choice models.\n",
